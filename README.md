# ðŸ“± SMS Spam Detection

A Machine Learning project to detect whether an SMS message is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
It uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and a trained **Logistic Regression** classifier with a **custom probability threshold (0.3)** to improve spam detection.  
The project also provides an interactive **Streamlit app** for easy predictions.
